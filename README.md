Download data about all GPUs from first 100 pages on Allegro.pl and first 160 pages of allegro.archiwum - archive.
Simple GUI to input what GPU I want information about. Information about used and new models are separeted. 
Weighted mean takes popularity of certain price into consideration (and ignores the offers which no-one bought).
